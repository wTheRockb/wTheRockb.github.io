<h1> Biography of Forrest Michael Butler, known as Woody "The Rock" Butler </h1>

<p> 
	Hi! My name is Woody. I run, I eat, I cook, I study, among other things. </p>                 

<p>I am currently studying at Tufts University, in Boston, MA, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurial & Leadership Studies. 
I am pursuing a career rooted somewhere between marketing, programming and tech, and plan to use my knowledge of these fields to help myself and others engage them more effectively.  This past year I expanded my studies from just chemistry to include the Entrepreneurial & Leadership Studies, as Tufts lacks any form of business degree, to expand my knowledge of the fundamentals of commerce. </p>

<p>My main passion would be the sport of Track and Field. I run the 400m dash on the Tufts University team, and on my high school team before that. I've always enjoyed the competitive energy track allows me to express, as well as the dedication and self-discipline that I've developed by being a varsity athlete for 7 years. The concept of pushing myself to my true, physical limit, to achieve things that so few others could at that time invigorates me. The last thing I have come to appreciate about the sport is the team aspect. In a sport comprised of many individual events, save the relays, it is easy to have a detached team. So easily could my team be divided into throws, sprints and distance. I think that is what makes it all the more meaningful a shot put thrower, or 10,000m runner looks me in the eye and congratulates me on a successful race, because they don't need to ask how I did if they know my time. The Tufts Track and Field team has provided a family away from home for me. </p>

<p>When I'm not running, working or studying I manage to spend little time on the couch. I am involved with some truly awesome extrcurricular activites that have taught me just as much as my classes. I'm a project manager for Tufts Consulting Collective, a pro bono consulting firm that is completely student run that gives free management consulting to local restaurants, clubs and other student groups. I am also the Secretary of Tuft's newly recognized American Chemical Society Chapter. Some more leisurely activities have found their way into my schedule, such as the very empowering LUX Fashion Show, where I modeled local designers to raise money for Half The Sky Foundation, and I've also performed in the Tufts Burlesque Troupe. </p>

<p>
In my downtime I relax by cooking (I make the best eggplant bhaji you've never had in your life,) usually Indian cuisine or Sushi. Even more than I cook I eat, my favorite cuisine by far being Mexican, however I am by no means a picky eater. I also enjoy dabbling in spanish language, gardening and casual runs on warm summer nights. </p>
