hackathon thoughts


Jennifer was a bad judge
most other judges were good. dont reinvite jennfier or the ones that didn't speak

Need to plan things ealier.
	design opening and closing powerpoints
	meals
	venue
	judges etc.
	judge prizes
	Better education of contestants about where water is?


Might help to have one main student leader
