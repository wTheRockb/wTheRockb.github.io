<h1> Using Elevator Pitches to Network Effectively </h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	
<p> What I enjoy about networking is it's open, collaborative nature. As we practiced this semester, an elevator pitch can help concisely 
	demonstrate your interests and experiences. I've actually continued practicing and changing my elevator speech since we presented them 
	in class because I'll be starting my full-time job in June 2016 and I'll be meeting dozens of new people in the first few weeks. 
</p>
<p>
	My first elevator speech was actually during Sophomore year at Tufts in my ELS 101 class. I'm thankful for the introduction to the concept 
	because I used mine relentlessly in my 4 career fairs that I've attended. During my first career fair, I was even specifically complimented
	that my pitch was well-developed for an underclassmen, and I later secured an interview from that exchange. I've also used it in dedicated
	networking events.
</p>

<p> Going forward, I'll need to continually revise my elevator pitch to reflect changes in my current achievements and goals. I'll continue
	to use it in formal and informal settings, and will perfect it with much practice.
