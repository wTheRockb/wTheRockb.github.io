<h1> Giving and Receiving Feedback</h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	
<p> 
	The act of giving and receiving feedback is a process we actively learned and practiced this semester. We discussed and researched
	many ways of how to give effective feedback and seek out constructive, actionable advice. I chose to include this lesson because 
	the feedback cycle is a critical part of improving oneself, and I want to put as much emphasis as possibl on personal improvement
	in my first job out of Tufts.
</p>
<p>
	I've seen firsthand how important it is to ask for specific, constructive feedback. One of my most prominent leadership experiences so
	far has been leading our group project during Jack Derby's Entrepreneurial Marketing program. We did an intense, semester-long project
	market reserach project that culminated	in an 80 page report, 20 minute presentation, 5 page whitepaper and blog post for our client
	in the restaurant loyalty space. At the end of this, I specifically reached out to my team of 5 others and performed surveys on how
	they think each other did, and how I did. The response were helpful and thoughtful, and I've actively made progress on the suggestions
	I was given, but because of the vagueness of the questions I posed, I received a huge variety of answer, in both scope and helpfulness.
</p>
<p>
	I see now how I could've done this feedback cycle better. If I were to do it again, I would first send out a survey that was smaller in
	scope, and focused on more specific points of problem in the project. This would be anonymized, and would largely be just to brainstorm
	and help the team collect their thoughts. Then, I would personally meet with every team member and talk with them for 5-10 minutes. A face 
	to face interaction would allow me to better see their body language and cues and it will be much easier for me to understand which points
	they wanted to emphasize the most.
