<h1> Emotional Intelligence Reflection </h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	
<p>
	One of the largest portions of the "Leadership In" module was centered around gaining a better understanding of our own selves
	and emotional intelligence. I've learned how critical it is to be aware of how you act in response to stressors and other people.
</p>
<p>
	This semester I took both Meyers Briggs and TKI personality exams, giving huge insights to my emotional behaviors. 
	
	<br>
	Meyers Briggs: <br>
	<blockquote>ENTJ - "Frank, decisive, assume leadership readily.  Quickly see illogical and inefficient procedures and policies, develop and implement comprehensive systems to solve organizational problems. Enjoy long-term planning and goal setting. Usually well-informed, well read, enjoy expanding their knowledge and passing it on to others. Forceful in presenting their ideas" </blockquote>
	<br>
	TKI: <br>

<p>
	Knowing these scores going forward gives me a better understanding of how I interact with others, both profesionally and socially. 
	I can let my teammates know my scores and encourage them to take exams that can help them understand themselves also. However more importantly, these scores give me good feedback on how I can improve myself in the context of a work team. For example, as an ENTJ, I can occasionally
	be too overpowering to others when promoting and presenting my own ideas. I now know to be more aware that I should be less self-righteous
	when presenting my ideas, and to keep an open mind.
