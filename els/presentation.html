<h1> Presentation Skills - Confidence is key</h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	

<p>
	Having confidence in one's presentation skills is key to being a charismatic presenter and having a strong stage presence. We
	actively worked on stage presence in our group practice sessions for elevator pitches and I realized I needed to work on 
	my confidence in my presentation. I think this is a particularly important leson because I think that confidence on stage
	during a presentation is linked to confidence in other areas of my life.
</p>
<p>
	I think I demonstrated practiced confidence in how I delivered my elevator speech this semester. I started off with a bold
	phrase ("My name's Woody Butler and I'm a kickass programmer who belongs in tech management"). I continued to deliver what I
	thought was a well-articulated and presented pitch. I owe this to my active work on self-confidence that I've gone through this
	school year. After a first semester in which I dealt with some minor depression and anxiety, I decided that I wanted to improve 
	my self confidence. I worked on walking around campus with correct posture and meditation techniques, both of which I attribute
	(along with helpful advice from classmates) to that powerful elevator speech.
</p>
<p>
	Moving forward, I can continue to work on my self confidence through continued public speaking and being proud of the work I 
	produce, leading to positive feedback. One pitfall I must be aware of while doing this is when confidence turns to overconfidence, 
	which can lead to me acting arrogant or self-righteous (double listed as something to work on from ENTJ in EQ section).
