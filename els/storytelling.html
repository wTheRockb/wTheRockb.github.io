<h1> Storytelling - Place of Why </h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	
<p>
	The "place of why" in storytelling originates from a Ted Talk given by Simon Sinek (linked below). It's the concept of not focusing 
	on the 'who', 'what' or 'how' of what you do, but the 'why'. This resonated with me as a Senior who is soon leaving Tufts and having 
	to essentially start to guide my own adult life. The 'why' is the passion or goal behind a motivation. I think that Simon's Ted Talk
	spoke to me that today because I had a different interpretation of the message. He presented the material in the context of business
	success, citing technology giants like Apple, however this concept of the 'why' goes beyond any commercial success.

	As of writing this, I'm a soon-graduated Tufts University senior. One of the most important life decisions I've made was this past
	December deciding between job offers. Context: I come from a lower income family where we've struggled financially before, and I came
	to Tufts for one reason: get a high-paying job to support my family so that we'd never face that again. When weighing my options, I 
	landed what I thought was my dream job, among some other great opportunities as well. I was saddened when I found out this dream job,
	working at a highly succesful startup with an energetic and passionate team, was paying significantly less than my other opportunities.
	I had to make a decision on my personal happiness at work versus my family's and my own further financial safety. Funnily enough, my father 
	himself gave me what I needed to make my decision. He told my "Son, your happiness is our happiness, and you sending home more money
	will never compare to us konwing that you love what you do".

	I hadn't seen that Ted Talk in December, or even heard of this concept of coming from 'a place of why' at that point, but I'd like to think
	I embraced that lesson back then by choosing what I realized truly was my dream job. In the future, I've decided that quite frankly life is
	too short to count money or material things in life, because what we physically do everyday is what literally constitutes most of our lives. 
	I want to sahre this philosophy with others and encourage them to live in the moment and to value the today of life, which will hopefully
	help them find their passions and their 'why'.
