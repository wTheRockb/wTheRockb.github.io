<h1> Improving Listening Skills</h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	
<p>
	We worked extensively on active listening techniques in class this semester. Of the many lessons we learned, my most
	important takeaway is communicating to people that they are being heard. I think this is a vital lesson because other listening 
	and communication skills will be futile if the person you are communicating with doesn't feel respected and acknowledged.

	When Karin Brandt of coUrbanize came into our class, she even discretely mentioned how important this lesson was to her. The
	entire mission of coUrbanize is to give more platforms and accessibility for people to be heard by the real estate developers
	and contractors that are operating within their communities. She talked about how people reacted positively to simply being able
	to easily voice their opinions on community matters that they often times wouldn't have access to otherwise. Even when she was 
	talking about leading her own team and her disagreements with her cofounder, she literally said (when recounting a conversation)
	"I hear what you're saying, but I disagree because". I thought this was a moving example of how relevant the class lessons are
	to real world applications.

	I hope to lead a small-medium sized team in the software development world, and there's constant meeting to discuss program architecture,
	review code and brainstorm ideas. I want to share these lessons we've learned with my team so we can all have effective discussion.
	I'd specifically share what we've learned about acknowledging others' voices and being comfortable challenging and ceding to others' ideas.
