<h1> Encouraging Thought Diversity </h1>
<a href="index.html"> Home </a>	
<p> Thought diversity is the concept of appreciating the unique opinions, talents and experiences of everyone on your team. This 
	is what drives innovation in an organization and can help prevent groupthink. I think is critical to leading any small-medium
	sized team because for a company to be succesful, it must reliably produce innovative ideas. This open-mindedness is one of the reasons
	I'm interested in entrepreneurship and am working in a startup next year.
</p>
<p> What first really interested me in this concept was a talk given by Tedd Rowe at INBOUND2015, Hubspot's marketing conference. Tedd is
	the Managing Director of Small and Medium Business Sales at Google, overseeing $5 Billion in sales channels annually. He talked about
	how incrementalism is a doomed business model and for an organization to survive it must continue to revolutionize the field it's in. 
	He provided Google as an outstanding example because so few technology companies from 1998 are still present. One thing he uses to
	encourage innovation on his team is the Brave Penguin award. It's name comes from the behavior of penguins marching to feed in the
	arctic. When they march to a hole in the ice, they march in single-file. When they arrive at the hole in the ice, the first penguin 
	instinctively dives in and the other penguins wait to see if he comes back with fish, or if he was killed by seals waiting below. 
	The award goes to someone who tries something new, regardless of the outcome. This allows team members to lose the fear of failure,
	and have the courage and individual freedom to innovate.
</p>
<p> 
	This idea is very implementable in a couple ways. Going forward, I can use the brave penguin award in my teams. Another part of 
	encouraging thought diversity is letting teammates know that these innovative ideas come from all across the company, not the
	c-suite executives and a few talented superstars. Also, another strategy I can do moving forward is to assign roles in conversations
	and meetings. For example, if someone is given the role of devils advocate, they might be much more liekely to challenge a coworker's
	idea without reprisal.
