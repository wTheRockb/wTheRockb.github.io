<h1> Woody Butler's Leadership Playbook </h1>
<p> The purpose of this page is to provide open access to a summary of the lessons we've learned in Entrepreneurial Leadership at Tufts
	(Spring 2016, Prof. Elizabeth McCarthy). The format of the report as seen below is individual lessons and concepts explored in 
	one page each. A website was chosen for the format so that I can access anywhere and for modularity for future use.
